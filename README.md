# wfc-gh

This is a project is inspired by WaveFunctionCollapse, by mxgmn. It does not approach the same level of completeness as the original, it is simply my own curiousity that led me to explore how WFC works, and try to re-create it and make it functional in Grasshopper. I focus on the overlapped model here. You can use the provided sample Rhino and Grasshopper files to play around with it yourself.
